        <h2>Arduino's Skeleton</h2>
        <p>Arnold has a soldered IR receiving circuit and audio detection circuit that hand on top of his top chassis.  That top chassis also has his IR emitting hat.  In his middle chassis, he has a multiplexer that takes in signals from the wall sensors and line sensors.  That mux is on a protoboard that simplifies the power and grounding for the mux, sensors, and motors.   There are two inner ground rails that are shorted together with two outer power rails on the main protoboard.  The mux sits on a carriage in the center of the board with the inputs going in as an ordered line for debugging purposes.</p>
        <p>Arnolds bottom chassis contains two batteries, for the arduino and for the servos.  It has one battery pushed forward to balance it and reduce the possibility of “jumping” in the GUI (it didn’t).</p>

    <section id="software" class="content-section bg-primary text-white">
      <div class="container">
        <h1>Software</h1>
        <h2>Bits and Bytes</h2>
        <p>For each hardware element of our robot, there was a software component behind it. The full code can be found <a href="https://github.com/ece3400-team16">here</a>, on our Github.</p>
        <p>To start, Arduino used the acoustic circuit from <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a> to detect a 660 Hz. As described in that lab, the acoustic signals were detected by the microphone in the circuit and run through an FFT, which put the strength of each signal at every frequency into a series of bins. To ensure that the FFT wouldn't cost our robot a lot of computing power and time, the bin that corresponded to the 660Hz signal was checked at the beginning of the competition and never checked again. The audio_detected function did this, and once it returned true, the robot was on its way through the maze.</p>
        <p>For the actual maze traversal itself, once the 660Hz signal had been detected, our depth-first search (DFS) algorithm was called. This algorithm was described fully in <a href="milestone3.html">Milestone 3</a>, but to give a high-level overview, it used a recursive function to proceed to every intersection within a specified-size maze. The movement of the robot was encoded into priorities, where moving forward took precedence (if there was no front wall of course), followed by turning left (if there was no left wall), and turning right (if there was no right wall). Since the function was recursive, if a path had been completely followed to visit all possible nodes along the way, the robot would then backtrack through the function stack. This was a more simplified final algorithm, but also one that required more complicated debugging along the way.</p>
        <p>Something interesting that this algorithm required, especially when it came to backtracking, was keeping track of direction. North, south, east, and west were static while in the maze, but our robot was constantly turning and referencing front, right, and left instead. This meant that we had to store the global direction, as well as a local variable to reference the previous direction the robot had been if it had visited that node before, so as to fully understand which walls needed to be checked with respect to its original orientation.</p>
        <p>This algorithm also ensured that there would be no collisions with other robots. As completed in <a href="lab2.html">Lab 2</a>, there was a circuit built to detect IR signals at 6kHz. Unlike the acoustic FFT, this FFT was running constantly, costing us computing time but also making sure that we didn't run into our competition. To fully integrate this circuit within our robot, there was a robot_detected() function, which would check the bins relevant to 6kHz and return a boolean to indicate whether a robot was nearby. The circuit had a small range of detection due to the phototransistor, so it was pointed forward on our robot to check and see if it would run into any robots ahead. Our concern was instigating a crash, not necessarily generally participating in it, and it would be clear that we had caused the crash if we had run into another robot in front of us.</p>
        <p>If a robot was detected, robot_reacted() would be called, a function we wrote to turn the robot around, proceed to the intersection it had just visited, and continue traversing through the maze as normal. It was essential that we continued with our recursive DFS implementation, even if a robot had been detected, because we needed to explore as much of the maze as possible and the backtracking aspect of our algorithm would allow us to do that.</p>
        <p>All of this information had to be confirmed by an actual human, so, using our code from <a href="lab3.html">Lab 3</a>, the location of the robot (stored using global variables that were updated in our DFS functions), the walls surrounding it (also updated from the DFS functions), and whether or not a robot had been detected were all transmitted in a compressed bit stream to our base station radio.</p>
