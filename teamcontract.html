        </ul>

        <h4>Method for setting and following meeting agendas:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Leader role for that period will be in charge of managing the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_BSLQBzHC71VsROPsBIRYu6QHQ-XS2UmidyK-1xpJ3M/edit#gid=0">action items spreadsheet</a></li>
          <li>Agenda for each meeting will encompass updates from every member, discussion of upcoming tasks, feedback of work and fellow team members, and allocation of tasks</li>

        <h4>Method of record keeping:</h4>

          <li>Minutes will be held in the Google Drive folder</li>
          <li>Orby Egboga will be team secretary, unless it becomes too much work, and then we’ll switch off</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Team Expectations</h3>
        
        <h4>Work Quality:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>First goal is to complete every lab and milestone, and then reevaluate after every lab and milestone if we’ll be able to put in the additional work to potentially win the final competition</li>
          <li>Any assignment must be completely fully to earn as many of the allocated points as possible</li>
          <li>Each team member is expected to complete their assigned action items as fully as possible</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Project standards:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Each team member is expected to fulfill their action items by the predetermined deadline</li>
          <li>Overall, each lab and milestone should be fully completed by at least 24 hours before the lab/milestone/assignment deadline</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Strategies to fulfill these standards:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Members should begin tasks early and complete in a timely manner (don’t wait until the last minute!)</li>
          <li>We all agree that starting work early and saving time for complications produces the best final outcome.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Team Participation:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Each team member is expected to contribute to each lab/milestone in some form.</li>
          <li>Team members with more knowledge/experience in certain fields are expected to speak up and volunteer their skills for those tasks.  Other team members who feel they are less experienced in certain fields will make efforts to learn those skills and assist the member with more experience.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Strategies to ensure cooperation and equal distribution of tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Members will be expected to consult action spreadsheet (detailed spreadsheet including tasks every member is expected to complete and the deadlines) regularly.</li>
          <li>Members are expected to communicate if they feel like they have too much or too little work outlined on the action sheet.</li>
          <li>Tasks on the action sheet can only be allocated with consent from the assigned team member.</li> 
        </ul>

        <h4>Strategies for encouraging/including ideas from all team members:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>When team members have ideas, they should:
            <ol>
              <li>Share them with the entire team</li>
              <li>Await feedback from each team member before deciding to move forward with/implement said idea</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>If a member (or members) has a problem with another member/members’ idea, they are expected to:
            <ul>
              <li>Communicate their concerns/issues with the idea</li>
              <li>Give valid reasons/feedback</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>All team members are expected to show respect/be courteous in such exchanges of ideas.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Strategies for keeping on task:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Team member in the leader role will be sure to check in occasionally with other team members concerning their action items</li>
          <li>Team members are expected to speak up if they have issues completing their action items</li>
          <li>All team members should keep a list of resources and people to turn to (both inside and outside of the team) if help is needed</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Preferences for leadership:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>A leader has been assigned for each milestone who is expected to take care of logistics (such as organizing team meetings and allocating tasks on action sheet)</li>
          <li>Other decisions are to made informally by group consensus</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Personal Accountability:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Expected individual attendance, punctuality, and participation at all team meetings</li>
          <li>Each member is expected to be at each team meeting (on time) unless previously discussed with other team members</li>
        </ul>
         
        <h4>Expected level of responsibility for fulfilling team assignments, timelines, and deadlines:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Each member should always complete the tasks allocated to them on action sheet to the best of their abilities and at the deadline previously decided as a team</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Expected level of communication with other team members:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If a member wants to make a significant change in a project, they must consult the entire team (via GroupMe or in person).  The team must reach consensus for such changes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Expected level of commitment to team decisions and tasks:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Members must reach consensus on all major team decisions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations</h3>

        <h4>Describe, as a group, how you would handle infractions of any of the obligations of this team contract:</h4>
        <ul>

        </ul>

        <h4>Describe what your team will do if the infractions continue:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>If a team member is continually cited for infractions, the team will report the member to either Professor Kirstin or teamwork expert Robin Parker for further assistance.</li>
